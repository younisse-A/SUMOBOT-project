# Project Timeline: September – November

September 11: We were introduced to our project on September 11 and visited the kindergarten children so they could choose their robot, decide its appearance, and define its functions.

September 18: We created the first prototype to present a visual representation of Dragon Snow.

September 20: We showed the first prototype to the children, and they were very happy and proud of the project.

September 20 – October 14:

- I programmed the robot to operate and adopt an effective combat strategy to defeat opposing robots.
- I programmed the blowpipe mechanism that allows the dragon to shoot fireballs.
- I also programmed the dragon’s sound, including the children’s voices shouting “Arrrggghhh, attack!” – this was the most time-consuming part.

October 15 – November 20:
We modeled the entire robot in SolidWorks according to the children’s requests:

- Red dragon
- Dragon head
- Butterfly wings
- Disney’s Elsa from Frozen on the dragon’s back
- A system to shoot fireballs (blowpipe)
- A support structure combining the blowpipe, dragon head, dragon body, butterfly wings, and Elsa into a single assembly – a “5-in-1” piece
Finally, we modeled a bumper to lift other robots.
Thanks to these features, we remained undefeated for 12 matches and finished 3rd in the university tournament.

November 20: The children visited to see the completed robot. They were all delighted and proud of the robot we built according to their preferences.

November 22–24: We assembled the dragon and completed the finishing touches.

November 27: Competition day.

Ranking: 3rd place in the tournament, with 12 wins out of 13 matches.
