1. Required Functions

- “The robot shoots fireballs from its mouth.”
    → Integrated blowpipe inside the head: rack‑and‑pinion mechanism driven by a servo motor.

 - “Push back the opposing robots.”
    → Front ramp designed to slightly lift and destabilize opponents.

- “The robot must look like a red dragon with pink butterfly wings and Elsa from Frozen on its back.”
   → 3D‑printed and assembled outer shell in red.

- “It must talk and shout.”
    → Speaker connected to the Arduino; it speaks using the children’s recorded voices.

2. Main Constraints

- Safety: short firing range, limited impact energy; no sharp or hazardous elements.

- Manufacturing: parts must be 3D-printable or easily cut; simple assembly (screws/clips/pins).

- Resources: use of lightweight and readily available materials.

- Maintenance: easy access to the blowpipe mechanism and wear components.

3. Key Technical Requirements

- Blowpipe: rigid guiding, repeatable firing, limited energy; accessible for projectile reloading.

- Legs: optimized inclined angle, reinforced local strength.

- Chassis / Shell: ensure stability (low center of gravity) and robust mounting of sub-assemblies.

- Materials: reinforced PLA 3D-printed plastic or plywood.

- Assembly: standard screw fasteners.

- Blowpipe sizing: projectile assumptions (mass/diameter), actuator selection, safety considerations.

- FEA (pinion): load cases, boundary conditions, allowable stress.

- Testing: firing range and repeatability tests, leg resistance tests (simulated impacts), stability verification during operation.

4. Planned Studies and Tests

- Blowpipe sizing: projectile assumptions (mass/diameter), actuator choice, safety validation.

- FEA on pinion: load analysis, boundary conditions, stress limits.

- Tests: blowpipe range & repeatability tests, leg resistance tests (simulated contacts), stability tests under real conditions.
